      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The Environment Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector
        Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        This website is partially compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web
          Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard</a>, due to the following exemptions.

      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons. </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h4>



      <p class="govuk-body">There are a few instances of non-compliance with WCAG level AA. These are:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          navigation landmarks do not provide a label that is descriptive enough to inform a user of their function, 
          which does not meet the requirement for WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and labels
        </li>
        <li>the Friendly Captcha grey information text does not meet the requirement for WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</li>
        <li>the map focus element does not meet the requirement for WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</li>
        <li>
          the colours used in the flood depth graphic, for both the grey against the white background and the grey 
          against the blue produce a contrast ratio, which does not meet the requirement for WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text 
          Contrast
        </li>
        <li>
          zoom controls are removed from various map pages when viewed in WCAG reflow settings at 1280 x 1024px at 
          a magnification of 400%. Additionally, the positioning of certain elements over the map does not account 
          for the addition of a scroll bar and some of the text is cropped. This does not meet the requirement for 
          WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">We will fix these issues in the following ways:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>we plan to add a descriptive aria-label attribute to the navigation landmark that allows a screen reader 
          to know this section is for page navigation</li>
        <li>we will make sure text colours used provide sufficient contrast against the background, so that the outlines 
          of the text characters are sufficiently defined for low vision users </li>
        <li>we plan to use the format indicated in the GOV.UK Design System, for understanding focus state styles</li>
        <li>we will make sure the flood depth graphics achieves a colour contrast ratio of least 3:1 against 
          any adjacent colours</li>
        <li>we plan to make sure the map pages can be viewed as a single column at 320px without any loss of content 
          or functionality </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">We will look to address these issues by December 2025.</p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The website has the following content which is out of scope of the accessibility regulations:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>maps</li>
        <li>third party content which is out of our control, for example a corporate logo on the map the website uses
        </li>
        <li>PDF content that was published before 23 September 2018</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>we have fixed 10 issues that failed to meet the WCAG version 2.2 A standard</li>
        <li>we are working to fix all other content which fails to meet the WCAG version 2.2 
          AA standard and we will update this page when these issues are fixed </li>
        <li>once we have fixed these issues, we will conduct usability testing with people with accessibility needs </li>
